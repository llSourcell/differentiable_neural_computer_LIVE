    "Neural networks excel at pattern recognition and quick, reactive decision-making, but we are only just \n",
    "beginning to build neural networks that can think slowly. that is, deliberate or reason using knowledge.\n",
    "For example, how could a neural network store memories for facts like the connections in a transport network \n",
    "and then logically reason about its pieces of knowledge to answer questions?\n",

    "this consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix,\n",
    "analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, \n",
    "but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are \n",
    "inaccessible to neural networks without external read–write memory.\n",

    "Modern computers separate computation and memory. Computation is performed by a processor, \n",
    "which can use an addressable memory to bring operands in and out of play. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to computers, the computational and memory resources of artificial neural networks \n",
    "are mixed together in the network weights and neuron activity. This is a major liability: \n",
    "as the memory demands of a task increase, these networks cannot allocate new storage \n",
    "dynam-ically, nor easily learn algorithms that act independently of the values realized \n",
    "by the task variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The whole system is differentiable, and can therefore be trained \n",
    "end-to-end with gradient descent, allowing the network to learn \n",
    "how to operate and organize the memory in a goal-directed manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the memory can be thought of as the DNC’s RAM, then the network, referred to as the ‘controller’, \n",
    "is a differentiable CPU whose operations are learned with gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How is it different from its predecessor, the Neural Turing Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "basically, more memory access methods than NTM\n",
    "\n",
    " DNC extends the NTM addressing the following limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Ensuring that blocks of allocated memory do not overlap and interfere.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Freeing memory that have already been written to.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Handling of non-contiguous memory through temporal links.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the system required hand-crafted input to accomplish its learning and inference. This is not an NLP system where unstructured text is applied at input. \n",
    "\n",
    "3 forms of attention for heads\n",
    "- content lookup\n",
    "- records transitions between consecutively written locations in an N ×  N temporal link matrix L.\n",
    "This gives a DNC the native ability to recover sequences in the order in which it wrote them, even\n",
    "when consecutive writes did not occur in adjacent time-step\n",
    "- The third form of attention allocates memory for writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Content lookup enables the formation of associative data structures;\n",
    "temporal links enable sequential retrieval of input sequences;\n",
    "and allocation provides the write head with unused locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "DNC memory modification is fast and can be one-shot, resembling the associative \n",
    "long-term potentiation of hippocampal CA3 and CA1 synapses\n",
    "\n",
    " Human ‘free recall’ experiments demonstrate the increased probability of \n",
    "   item recall in the same order as first pre-sented (temporal links)\n",
    "    \n",
    "DeepMind hopes that DNCs provide both a new tool for computer science and a new metaphor for cognitive science\n",
    "and neuroscience: here is a learning machine that, without prior programming, can organise information\n",
    "into connected facts and use those facts to solve problems."
